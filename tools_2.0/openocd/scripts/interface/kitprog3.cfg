# Cypress Semiconductor KitProg3
#
# KitProg3 is CMSIS-DAP compliant adapter. However, it supports additional functionality
# such as SPI/I2C bridging, Hardware acquire procedure for PSoC 4/5/6 devices, power control.
# This functionality has been moved to separate driver to avoid pollution of generic CMSIS-DAP
# with probe-specific code.
#
# Interface driver inherits all functionality of CMSIS-DAP including all tcl commands.
# Additional functionality can be accessed via tcl using 'kitprog3' prefix
#

interface kitprog3

# Only SWD is currently supported
transport select swd

# Average SWD frequency is ~1500 kHz
